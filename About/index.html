  <p>I'm Vatricia Edgar, Software Engineering student at ASU. This blog has been created for my work with the Collaborative Research 
    Experiences for Undergraduates (CREU) through CRA-W. My group's research is in Semantic Web, Linked Data and Big Data. Our goal is
    to use publicly available information to create neighborhood sustainability ratings and then present that datta as a web or mobile app
