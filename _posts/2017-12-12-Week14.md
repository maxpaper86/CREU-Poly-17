This week was the end of finals andd also my birthday on the 9th. <excerpt> I decided to work on my webcrawler instead off on the US Census data and on other sustainability data. I hope that the webcrawler will help us tackle the issue of small towns. I am currently refining the crawler to take on more complex tasks than it currently does. I am looking into HTML parsing to have a more robust way of gathering data. I have also looked into RDF/OWL tools for Java applications. Nextweek I hope to have more up-to-ddate crawler code.
