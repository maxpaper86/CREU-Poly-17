This week was another busy week for me in school, but I still got to study up on some Java tools and look for data sets. In our meeting, our group discussed the ontology and agreed on a few changes for it. In the coming week, my goal is to fully understand how to create the instance data and query it before Sunday, and after Sunday our group will discuss where to get the data.
