This week I began to think about the programming side of the project in more depth. I started to fill out the first step in building ontologies from the “ontology 101” document available from Protogé’s website. This is the same doc I used for my practice ontology earlier. <excerpt>I filled out the steps as much as I could but most of the questions needed to be answered as a group. I plan to bring these concerns up tomorrow at our meeting. 

I also began to think about the classes and properties of our ontology. These are the main classes I made. I have more detailed notes on these in my notes: 

* Index: This is the broad area of sustainability. The rankings represent the level of sustainability
    * Attributes:
        * A ranking
        * A list of factors
    
*	Factor: This is the smaller area of sustainability. They are used to calculate the ranking of an index
    *	Attributes:
        * A ranking
        * A list of factors
        * A list of indicators
    
*	Indicator: This is a single, simple measurement used to calculate the score of a factor
    *	Attributes:
        * A ranking

As part of going through the ontology 101 steps, I also began to compile a list of existing ontologies we can reuse. I found a few ontologies that describe cities in detail, but they are only base ontologies. I geographical ontologies might also bee useful. I overall found it difficult to search for ontologies.

Lastly, I began compiling terms that we will need to describe in our ontology. I quickly stopped because it is difficult to come up with terms when we still do not know which area of sustainability we are working with. Instead, I looked into making a web crawler so we can automate compiling terms and other data. This is a simple web crawler and I am not finished with it.
