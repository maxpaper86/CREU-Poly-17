This week was really productive! The team met to talk about our data sources. I'm using some data from the US Census Bureau to fill in many off our social and econmmic sustainability indicators.<excerpt> I created a program that will taken in a city name and state code (Exampe: Miami, FL) and return a FIPS code, the code used by the data. I also created a program that parses the data variables file to make them easy to read. Now, all that is left to do is choose the variables and create a program to gather the data and write it to our ontology as instance data. This will be done in these steps:
Choose variables.
Parse the data variables xml file to find the variable codes.
Use the variable codes and FIPS codes to create a URL for requesting data from the Census Bureau API.
Parse the data files to get the information required.
Put this information into the ontology.
This coming week, I will focus on two things: Continuing to study the Census Bureau API so I can get the data, and studying the Jena API so I can write it. I am much more familiar with the Census Bureau API at this point, so I want to finish that up quickly and move to learning how to write the data.
