This week we went to the innovation showcase. We showed off a poster on our project and presented a demo of the app. <excerpt> We got a lot of visitors and suggestions for taking the app further, including suggestions for 'commercial' implementation and for continuing research.
In addition to that, we have continued work on developping the application. Since my computer broke two weeks ago I have hadd trouble getting started again but I have finally gotten the project set up on my temporary computer and I am continuing work filling in the ontology.
This week our group also has to finish the final report, and we all have our final exams, so it is a lot of work for all of us!
