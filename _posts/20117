This week was the last week of classes and the beginning of finals week, so my research was limited to a few hours of basic googling. <exerpt> My focus so far has been on how to get sustainability information from smaller towns that do not have a lot of open data. Last week I was able to sort through some census data, but most of that was focused on the economic aspect of sustainability. This week I searched for environmental data, things like water quality and waste disposal. I found some data on the recycling rates of counties, but Iâ€™m having issues finding data on most anything else. My goal this week will be to find more waste data, along with data on energy. Additionally, I want to find a way to transform the Census Bureau data into RDF data using Java.
