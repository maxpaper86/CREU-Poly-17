This week I worked on put the data into the onotlogy. I learned how to use Apache Jena and I have part of the program already made. Right now, I am able to add new indicators under the correct factor, which is just an alteration of the ontology deffinition. Now I am working on adding instance data to the ontology.
Additionally, I made some changes to the ontology, such as setting the rank of indicators, factors, sub-indices and indices, or including the name of a city.
