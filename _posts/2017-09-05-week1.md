This first week has actually been a lot of fun despite it mostly consisting of setup and review. I met with my faculty mentors and teammates in our first meeting. We touched bases, discussing the project, our skill sets, and resources we could use. This week I also reviewed literature related to our research and set up this blog.
The literature review was very interesting, I read about the Semantic Web, Linked Data, and Big Data. The articles got me thinking about the technologies and their applications, not only in our research but also in my broader interest areas. This week I plan on diving more into th literature and looking at the syntax of SPARQL, RDF, XML, and the other tools we will be using.
In addition to the literature review, I have been working on creating this blog via GitHub Pages. Being new to GitHub Pages, I stumbled a bit, particularly with getting my posts to display. I knew that the posts existed and that GitHub Pages “knew” that it existed because it was displayed in the lists of posts. But, the link for the post brought me to a 404-error page. Now hat the problem has been solved, I plan o customizing the blog’s HTML and CSS for a better look.
