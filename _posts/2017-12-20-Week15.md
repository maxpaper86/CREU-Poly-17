This week was super productve! I have started to realy refine my webcrawler. <exerpt> It is collecting way more pages than it did before and I am working on ways to refine those pages. There isn't much to explain really. I am now narrowing down pages by the date they were last updated and traveling to relative links. I have also created a link object which will sore data about a link and help me determine which links will be most useful to search and likely have good data. I also have implemented a new search algorithm in doing this which is more efficient. This week I am going to get into the nitty gritty of the data, figuring out which linksto travel and how to get data out of the elements and convert them to useful data. I will hopefully be learning a lot about combining Java and OWL. Christmas is this week so I don't know how mmuch I will geet done butI am hopeful.
