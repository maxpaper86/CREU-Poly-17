---This week I finished selecting variables from the American Community Survey. <excerpt>The data set will provide our team with data involving the Social and Economic domains of sustainabilty. I also finished writing a program to query the data from the Census Bureau and all I need now is to parse this data and add it to the ontology.
Before finishing up the work with the American Community Survey, I also began looking for more data in areas that the ACS did not cover, including crime statistics, business and infrastructure data, and energy, pollution, and conservation data. I have found many data sets that look like they might work and I am getting ready to learn more about the structure of each.
Our group also finished writing a proposal this week for a poster at the Grace Hopper Celebration.
