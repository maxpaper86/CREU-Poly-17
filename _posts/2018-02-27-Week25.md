This week I continued figuring out how to read the Census Bureau ata. I still need to selecct the codes, but I have been testing parsing on some codes and all is coming along smoothly. I found out that the FIPS code is no longer in use, but I found a table filled with the newer code and I figured out how to extract metropolitan areas from that. I am nearlydone figuring out are to parse the Census data and I will move on to Apache Jena shortly.
