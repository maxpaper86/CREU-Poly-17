This week I continued considering technologies we can use. I made a simple web crawler for practice and have been reading tutorials on HTML parsing and other ways of gathering data. This week I plan on looking into definitions, so we can start making our ontology. We need to define a neighborhood and the sustainability indicators that will be important to our audience. This week our group will have an extra meeting to solve these problems.
